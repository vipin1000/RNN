Sentiment Analysis with Keras & TensorFlow 🧠💬
Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task where the goal is to determine the sentiment expressed in a given text. This project uses Keras and TensorFlow to build a deep learning model that classifies product reviews into three categories: Positive, Neutral, and Negative.

The model processes customer review texts, tokenizes and pads them, and then predicts the sentiment based on the content of the reviews.

# 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for sentiment classification. The workflow involves:

Tokenizing product reviews.
Padding the sequences to ensure equal input length.
Training a neural network to predict sentiment from text.
Evaluating the model performance on test data.
Making predictions on new, unseen text.
The architecture is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with a custom function to create the model.

# 🧠 Model Architecture
The model is a simple neural network designed for text classification. The key components include:

Tokenizer: Converts text into sequences of integers (using Keras).
Padding: Ensures that all input sequences have the same length.
Neural Network: A model built with layers that can learn the patterns between the text input and the sentiment output.
The architecture was created with the following steps:

Tokenizer is used to transform texts into integer sequences.
Padding is applied to make sure that all sequences are of equal length.
The model is trained with a training dataset and evaluated using a validation set.
# 📝 Usage # 
# Step 1: Prepare Your Data
The model expects labeled text data:

Positive reviews are labeled as 1.
Negative reviews are labeled as 0.
Neutral reviews are labeled as 2.

# Step 2: Tokenization and Padding
Tokenize the texts and convert them into sequences of integers. This ensures the model can interpret the text data correctly and make predictions.

# Step 3: Split the Data
The dataset is split into training and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.

# Step 4: Create and Train the Model
Once the data is ready, the neural network model is created and trained on the training dataset. The training process involves adjusting the weights of the network so that it can make accurate predictions.

# Step 5: Evaluate the Model
After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to see how well it performs. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, loss, and more.

#  Step 6: Predict Sentiment
After the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text. This can be used for real-time predictions, such as analyzing product reviews or customer feedback.

# 📊 Sample Output
Model Performance (Test Data):
The model achieves a high accuracy in predicting sentiments from the test data.

# Predictions on New Text:
Text: "This product is amazing!" → Sentiment: Positive
Text: "Worst product ever" → Sentiment: Negative
Text: "It was just okay, nothing special." → Sentiment: Neutral
# ✨ Features
🌍 Multilingual: With appropriate training, this model can be extended to multiple languages.
🕹️ Real-time Predictions: The model can predict the sentiment of any new product review text.
🚀 Scalable: The model can be fine-tuned with more data for higher accuracy.
⚙️ Model Creation Details
The model architecture is created using a custom function. It includes:

Embedding Layer: Transforms integer sequences into dense vectors.
LSTM Layer: A type of recurrent neural network layer that is great for handling sequences.
Dense Layer: Outputs the sentiment prediction using softmax activation for multi-class classification.
# 🎯 Next Steps
Improve Model: You can fine-tune the model by adding more layers, experimenting with different activation functions, and using pre-trained embeddings like GloVe.
Deploy: Deploy this model as a web app using Flask or FastAPI and allow users to predict the sentiment of reviews in real-time!
Extend Dataset: Add more product reviews for improved accuracy. A larger dataset can provide better generalization.
